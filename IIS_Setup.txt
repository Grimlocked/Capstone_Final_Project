This is a setup file for IIS. This displays the steps to take in order to make it publically accessible
1, Install 'web platform installer 5.1'
2, Install php 7.3.7

3, Add application to IIS
	-Create an application pool (for ease of sec. management)
		ex: ScheduleApp
	-Add site name (can be anything)
		ex: Gamers Rise Up
	-Assign to application pool (preferably not deffault)
		ex: ScheduleApp
	-Add physical path (ensure the app is in 'inetpub' folder and that IIS has read access to path)
		ex: C:\inetpub\groupProject
	-Bind to IP, Port, and protocol
		ex: http://192.168.30.1:8079
	-Optional: add hostname

	Ensure that IIS has read access to the applications path 

4, Edit php.ini
	-Create a phpinfo.php file in 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot'
	-Create a php.ini if it doesn't already exist
	-Edit the file to parameters in 'Server Production ini' document
	-Ensure that, 
		"[PHP_WINCACHE]
		extension=php_wincache.dll"
		...is at the end of the php.ini
	-Delete 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot\phpinfo.php' as it's a security hazard




5, Setup phpmyadmin
	-Download phpmyadmin.zip and extract to website dirctory
		Ex: inetpub/wwwroot/phpmyadmin
	-Add a config folder to the phpmyadmin folder and give IIS_USERS permissions on it
	-Go to http://[IP]:[PORT]/phpmyadmin/setup/ and add a server
		Ex: 1	MySQL	cookie	mysqli://127.0.0.1:3306
	-Save the config.ini.php file to the phpmyadmin folder

6, Create the database
	-in phpmyadmin, run the commands specified in the groupproject.sql folder

7, Create User


5, Test application
	-At this point, IIS will create a 'web.config' file for the app
