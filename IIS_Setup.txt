This is a setup file for IIS. This displays the steps to take in order to make it publically accessible
1, Install 'web platform installer 5.1'
2, Install php 7.3.7

3, Add application to IIS
	-Create an application pool (for ease of sec. management)
		ex: ScheduleApp
	-Add site name (can be anything)
		ex: Gamers Rise Up
	-Assign to application pool (preferably not deffault)
		ex: ScheduleApp
	-Add physical path (ensure the app is in 'inetpub' folder and that IIS has read access to path)
		ex: C:\inetpub\groupProject
	-Bind to IP, Port, and protocol
		ex: http://192.168.30.1:8079
	-Optional: add hostname

	Ensure that IIS has read access to the applications path 

4, Edit php.ini
	-Create a phpinfo.php file in 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot'
	-Create a php.ini if it doesn't already exist
	-Edit the file to parameters in 'Server Production ini' document
	-Delete 'C:\inetpub\wwwroot\phpinfo.php' as it's a security hazard
5, Test application
	-At this point, IIS will create a 'wen.config' file
